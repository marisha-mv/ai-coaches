# The Marisha Skill
## A Growth Hacking Framework for High-Converting Funnels & Compliant Checkout Experiences

---

## What Is The Marisha Skill?

The Marisha Skill is a systematic methodology for transforming underperforming funnels into high-converting revenue machines. It covers landing pages, webinar funnels, email sequences, checkout pages, and post-event follow-up — combining conversion psychology, premium UX, compliance requirements, and strategic copywriting into a repeatable framework.

**Core Philosophy:** Most funnels fail because they talk AT visitors instead of taking them on an emotional journey toward transformation. And most funnel operators think the conversation ends too early. On checkout pages, most fail because they try to be clever instead of clear.

**The Three Pillars:**
1. **Conversion** - Psychology + Copy + Structure that moves visitors to action
2. **Compliance** - FTC, accessibility, and billing disclosure that protects the business
3. **Consistency** - Every number, promise, and element must align across the funnel

---

## The Two-Crisis Framework

**Before diving into tactics, diagnose the real problem.**

Most funnels don't have 10 problems. They have 1-2 CRITICAL bottlenecks holding everything back. Everything else is "nice to have."

**How to identify your crises:**

| Metric | Crisis Level | Good | Excellent |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| CPL (free webinar) | >$40 | $15-25 | <$15 |
| CPL (paid event) | >$100 | $50-80 | <$50 |
| Show-up rate | <20% | 25-35% | >40% |
| Landing page conversion | <20% | 30-40% | >50% |
| Revenue per attendee | <$100 | $150-300 | >$375 |

**Rule:** Find the 1-2 metrics at CRISIS level. Fix those first. Everything else unlocks after.

---

## The 5-Phase Framework

### Phase 1: AUDIT
*Score the funnel before you touch it*

**The 5-Dimension Scoring System (1-10 each):**

| Dimension | What You're Measuring |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Structure** | Page length, information hierarchy, section flow |
| **Copy** | Headlines, CTAs, value propositions, testimonials |
| **Conversion** | Urgency, scarcity, social proof, friction points |
| **Psychology** | Emotional arc, aspiration vs fear, identity transformation |
| **Infrastructure** | Deliverability, follow-up sequences, backup channels |

**Landing Page Audit Questions:**
- [ ] How long is the page? (Ideal: 3,000-6,000px)
- [ ] Is there video content?
- [ ] Does the CTA contrast with the page?
- [ ] Is there urgency/scarcity?
- [ ] Do visitors know "who's in the room"?
- [ ] Are testimonials scannable (headlines, not just quotes)?
- [ ] Is the price anchored or hidden?

**Webinar Funnel Audit Questions:**
- [ ] Is there a video explainer on registration page?
- [ ] Does the thank you page auto-add to calendar?
- [ ] Is there a free bonus delivered immediately?
- [ ] Are there qualification questions to identify VIPs?
- [ ] Is there a WhatsApp/SMS backup channel?
- [ ] Are emails hitting inbox or spam? (Check SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- [ ] Is there a post-webinar follow-up sequence?

---

### Phase 2: PSYCHOLOGY
*Understand what actually drives action*

**The Emotional Arc:**
```
TENSION → PAIN → HOPE → BELIEF → DESIRE → FOMO → ACTION
```

Most pages are flat. Great pages build to a crescendo.

**The 4 Psychological Triggers:**

1. **Aspiration Over Fear**
   - ❌ "95% of AI pilots fail" (assumes they identify with failure)
   - ✅ "Join the top 5% capturing millions in AI value"

2. **Identity Transformation**
   - ❌ "Learn about AI" (information)
   - ✅ "Become the AI-empowered executive" (transformation)

3. **Status & Belonging**
   - "Who's in the room?" matters more than "What's in the course?"
   - Show companies represented, industries, role breakdowns

4. **Loss Aversion > Gain Seeking**
   - ❌ "Attend and learn X" (gain-seeking)
   - ✅ "Don't attend and LOSE access to $97 handbook" (loss aversion)
   - Loss aversion is 2X more powerful than gain seeking

**The Enemy Principle:**
Every great sales page needs a villain. Define what you're fighting against:
- The old way of doing things
- Competitors who are moving faster
- Consultants who overcomplicate
- Technology that doesn't deliver

**The 78% Rule (Hormozi):**

Pre-webinar content consumption is the #1 predictor of conversion. When registrants consume content BEFORE the webinar, their show-up and conversion rates skyrocket.

| Pre-Event Engagement | Expected Conversion |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| No pre-consumption | 2-5% |
| Partial consumption | 8-12% |
| 78%+ consumption | 15-25%+ |

**How to apply:**
- Deliver valuable content immediately on thank you page
- Send "homework" before the webinar
- Create a pre-webinar video series
- Track engagement and segment VIPs for personal follow-up

**Rule:** The sale happens BEFORE the webinar. Your job during the webinar is just to close what's already primed.

---

### Phase 3: COPY
*Words that convert*

**Headline Formulas:**

```
Formula 1: [WHO] + [SPECIFIC OUTCOME] + [COUNTERINTUITIVE MECHANISM]
```
Example: "How 7-Figure Business Owners Are Adding $50K/Month in Profit While Working 20 Fewer Hours/Week"

```
Formula 2: [PROBLEM] + [COST] + [TIMEFRAME TO SOLUTION]
```
Example: "The Hidden 'Profit Leaks' Costing 7-Figure Businesses $50K-$100K Per Year (And How to Plug Them in 90 Days)"

```
Formula 3: [Transformation/Outcome] + [Specificity] + [For Who]
```
Example: "Turn AI Into Millions In Enterprise Value"

**Headlines to AVOID:**
- ❌ "Register for Free Webinar" (no outcome)
- ❌ "The AI Sweet Spot For C-Suite Leaders" (descriptive, not transformative)
- ❌ "Learn How To..." (information, not transformation)

---

**CTA Formulas:**

1. **The YES Statement + Action + Bonus:**
   - ❌ "Click here to join"
   - ✅ "✓ YES - Add to My Calendar & Get the $97 Hiring Handbook FREE"

2. **Commitment + Scarcity:**
   - ❌ "Register Now"
   - ✅ "✓ Save My Spot (And Get the $97 Handbook Before It Expires)"

3. **Value + Urgency:**
   - ❌ "Book a Call"
   - ✅ "Get Your Free AI Opportunity Assessment (Only 12 Spots Left)"

**CTA Rules:**
- Button must CONTRAST (gold/orange on purple, not purple on purple)
- Say what they GET, not what they DO
- Add scarcity when it's REAL

---

**Email Subject Line Formulas:**

Pattern interrupts beat boring reminders.

| Timing | ❌ Before | ✅ After |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 7 days | "You're registered!" | "⚠️ You're about to lose access to this $97 handbook" |
| 3 days | "Webinar in 3 days" | "[Tomorrow, 11:30am CST] What not to wear to your Zoom webinar with 400 people 👀" |
| 1 day | "Reminder: Webinar Tomorrow" | "I almost cancelled tomorrow's webinar. Here's why I didn't." |
| 2 hours | "Starting soon" | "Starting in 2 hours. Your $97 handbook expires if you miss it." |
| 15 min | "Join now" | "⏰ 15 minutes. Last chance for your handbook." |

**Pattern:** Loss aversion + specificity + pattern interrupts + countdown

---

**Testimonial Formula:**
```
[SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT] + [Specific mechanism] + [Name + Avatar]
```

- ❌ "Stacy's framework really helped my business."
- ❌ "Great webinar!"
- ✅ "I saved $30K in recruiting costs using Stacy's hiring framework" — Sarah M., 7-Figure E-commerce
- ✅ "Added $72K in annual profit by fixing one 'hidden leak' in my business" — Mike T., SaaS Founder

**Rule:** 5 strong testimonials with dollar amounts > 15 vague testimonials

---

**Value Stack Formula:**
```
"Join this free webinar and you'll discover:

→ The [NUMBER] '[FRAMEWORK NAME]' hiding in every [AVATAR] (and the [TIME]-minute audit that finds them)
→ How to [OUTCOME] without [PAIN POINT]
→ The '[TOOL NAME]' that [SPECIFIC BENEFIT]
→ BONUS: Get the [DELIVERABLE] (normally $[PRICE], yours free today)"
```

---

### Phase 4: STRUCTURE
*The flow that converts*

**Landing Page Flow:**

| Section | Purpose | Ideal Height |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Hero + CTA | Hook + primary action | ~800px |
| Social Proof | Logos, "as seen in" | ~300px |
| Video | Build trust, explain value | ~500px |
| About/Credibility | Why trust this person | ~600px |
| Problem/Solution | The framework/methodology | ~600px |
| Who It's For | Self-selection | ~500px |
| Who's In The Room | Peer validation | ~400px |
| Value Stack | What they get | ~600px |
| Testimonials | Proof it works | ~500px |
| FAQ (accordion) | Objection handling | ~400px |
| Final CTA | Close with urgency | ~400px |

**Total: ~5,000-6,000px** (not 24,000px!)

---

**Webinar Funnel Flow:**

```
REGISTRATION PAGE
    ↓
THANK YOU PAGE (calendar + bonus + qualification + WhatsApp opt-in)
    ↓
EMAIL SEQUENCE (7 days → 3 days → 1 day → 2 hours → 15 min)
    ↓
WEBINAR (with THE STACK)
    ↓
POST-WEBINAR SEQUENCE (THE MONEY IS HERE)
    Phase 1: Days 1-2 (Replay available, soft CTA)
    Phase 2: Days 3-7 (Replay expired, urgency escalation)
```

---

**THE STACK: Webinar Sales Structure**

THE STACK is non-negotiable. This is the Fladlien DNA — build value layer by layer before revealing price.

```
WEBINAR STRUCTURE:
├── Introduction (5 min)
│   └── Establish credibility, set expectations
├── Content (30-40 min)
│   └── Deliver genuine value, build trust
├── Transition (5 min)
│   └── "Now let me show you how to accelerate..."
├── THE STACK (15-20 min)
│   ├── Component 1: Core Program → Value: $X
│   ├── Component 2: Bonus 1 → Value: $Y
│   ├── Component 3: Bonus 2 → Value: $Z
│   ├── Component 4: Bonus 3 → Value: $A
│   └── TOTAL VALUE: $XXXXX
├── Price Reveal
│   └── "But you're not paying $XXXXX. Your investment today is just $YYYY"
├── Guarantee
│   └── Risk reversal, money-back terms
└── Close + Q&A (10-15 min)
    └── Urgency, limited spots, deadline
```

**THE STACK Rules:**
1. **Value first, price last** - Never reveal price before stacking value
2. **Each component gets a value** - Anchor high, but be believable
3. **Bonuses must be irresistible** - "You keep these even if you cancel"
4. **Total value should be 10X price** - If price is $2K, stack to $20K+
5. **Price reveal = relief moment** - They should feel "that's it?!"

**The Peak Commitment Moment:**

The moment right after THE STACK reveal — when value is at maximum and price is at minimum — is when you need the strongest CTA. This is the peak emotional state for buying.

- ❌ Weak: "Click the link below"
- ✅ Strong: "Click the button now, secure your spot, and claim all $23,497 in bonuses before they're gone"

---

**The Post-Webinar Blind Spot:**

Most funnel operators think the conversation ends after the webinar. That's where the REAL money is.

**Phase 1: Replay Available (Days 1-2)**
- Day 1: "Thanks + Replay + Book Call" (replay link + 48hr access + "12 spots left")
- Day 2: "FAQ + Objection Crusher + Last Day for Replay"

**Phase 2: Replay Expired - Urgency (Days 3-7)**
- Day 3: "Replay Expired - Here's What You Missed" ("8 spots left")
- Day 4: "Case Study" (specific transformation story)
- Day 5: "The Real Cost of Waiting" (ROI math + "5 spots left")
- Day 6: "Last 48 Hours" ("2 spots left")
- Day 7: "Cart Close" ("closes tonight, 1 spot left")

**The Spot Countdown:** 12 → 8 → 5 → 2 → 1. Must be REAL and VISIBLE.

**Revenue impact:** +$100K per webinar from this sequence alone.

---

**Bonus Retention Language:**

One of the most powerful psychological triggers — "keep the bonuses even if you cancel."

```
"And here's the thing — even if you decide this isn't for you and ask for a refund
within 30 days, you KEEP the $2,497 Hiring Handbook, the $997 Templates, and the
$497 Swipe Files. They're yours forever, no matter what."
```

**Why it works:**
1. Reduces perceived risk to zero
2. Creates goodwill and trust
3. Increases perceived value of bonuses
4. Makes the decision feel "can't lose"

**Rule:** Always mention bonus retention during THE STACK and in post-webinar emails.

---

**Escalating Urgency Pattern:**

Urgency must escalate across the 7-day post-webinar sequence. Static urgency = no urgency.

| Day | Urgency Level | Spots Left | Messaging |
|-----|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Low | 12 spots | "Replay available, here's what you missed" |
| 2 | Medium | 12 spots | "Last day for replay, 12 spots left" |
| 3 | Medium-High | 8 spots | "Replay expired, 4 spots claimed, 8 left" |
| 4 | High | 5 spots | "Case study + only 5 spots remain" |
| 5 | Very High | 5 spots | "Cost of waiting + 5 spots, prices going up" |
| 6 | Critical | 2 spots | "48 hours left, only 2 spots" |
| 7 | Final | 1 spot | "Closes tonight, literally 1 spot left" |

**Rules:**
- Numbers must be REAL (if you say 12 spots, have 12 spots)
- Countdown must be VISIBLE in emails
- Escalation must feel natural, not fabricated

---

### Phase 5: INFRASTRUCTURE
*The invisible conversion killers*

**Email Deliverability Checklist:**
- [ ] SPF configured
- [ ] DKIM configured
- [ ] DMARC configured
- [ ] Sending domain warmed up
- [ ] Test emails hitting inbox (not spam/promotions)

**Rule:** Best copy in the world is worthless if it goes to spam.

**The Show-Up Rate Decline Diagnostic:**

When show-up rates decline over time (e.g., 24.8% → 15.6%), it signals:
1. Email deliverability degradation (most common)
2. Audience fatigue/saturation
3. Offer/positioning mismatch
4. Reminder sequence decay

**Rule:** If show-up rates were EVER higher, the infrastructure is broken — not the audience.

---

### Phase 6: COMPLIANCE
*The protection that keeps you in business*

**The FTC Negative Option Rule (effective May 2025):**

If you sell subscriptions, memberships, or any recurring billing, you MUST comply with the FTC Negative Option Rule. Non-compliance = fines, lawsuits, and refund liability.

**Mandatory Requirements:**

| Requirement | What It Means | How to Implement |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Clear disclosure** | Billing terms must be obvious before purchase | Show "$X/month, billed monthly" prominently |
| **Informed consent** | Customer must affirmatively agree | Checkbox: "I understand I will be billed $X/month" |
| **Easy cancellation** | Cancel must be as easy as signup | One-click cancel, no hoops, no dark patterns |
| **Confirmation** | Written confirmation of terms | Email receipt with billing terms |

**The Billing Disclosure Principle:**

> "If a customer can miss the billing terms, you've already failed compliance."

```
❌ WRONG:
[Buy Now $47]
*terms apply, see below for details

✅ RIGHT:
[Subscribe - $47/month]
☑️ I understand I will be charged $47 monthly until I cancel
Cancel anytime with one click
```

**Checkout Page Compliance Checklist:**
- [ ] Billing frequency visible at point of purchase (not buried)
- [ ] Total price including any trials clearly stated
- [ ] Cancellation method explained before purchase
- [ ] Consent checkbox for recurring billing
- [ ] Order confirmation email with billing terms

---

**WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Standards:**

Accessibility isn't optional — it's both legal compliance (ADA) and smart UX (10-15% of users have some form of disability).

**The 4 Principles (POUR):**

| Principle | Meaning | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Perceivable** | Users can perceive content | Alt text, captions, sufficient contrast |
| **Operable** | Users can navigate | Keyboard navigation, no time limits |
| **Understandable** | Users can understand | Clear language, consistent navigation |
| **Robust** | Works with assistive tech | Semantic HTML, ARIA labels |

**Critical Accessibility Checks:**

| Element | Requirement | How to Test |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Color contrast** | 4.5:1 minimum for text | Use contrast checker tools |
| **Alt text** | All images must have descriptive alt | Inspect image tags |
| **Keyboard nav** | All interactive elements focusable | Tab through page |
| **Form labels** | All inputs must have labels | Screen reader test |
| **Link purpose** | Links must describe destination | No "click here" links |

**Contrast Ratios:**
```
WCAG AA Minimum:
- Normal text: 4.5:1
- Large text (18px+): 3:1
- UI components: 3:1

Common Failures:
- Light gray on white: ~2:1 ❌
- Purple on dark purple: ~2.5:1 ❌
- White on deep purple: ~8:1 ✅
```

**Rule:** Run every checkout page through WAVE or axe accessibility tools before launch.

---

**The Clarity Over Cleverness Principle:**

On checkout pages, clever copy kills conversions. Users are in decision mode — they need clarity, not creativity.

| Element | ❌ Clever | ✅ Clear |
|---------|----------|---------|
| CTA button | "Let's Do This!" | "Complete Purchase - $197" |
| Trial terms | "Try risk-free*" | "7-day trial, then $47/month" |
| Guarantee | "We've got your back" | "30-day money-back guarantee" |
| Pricing | "Less than a coffee/day" | "$27/month, billed monthly" |

**Rule:** If you have to explain what a button does, it's too clever.

---

**Visual Balance on Checkout:**

Checkout pages need visual hierarchy that guides the eye to the action.

```
IDEAL CHECKOUT LAYOUT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LOGO (trust signal)                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ORDER SUMMARY                      │
│  - What they're getting             │
│  - Price breakdown                  │
│  - Billing terms (prominent)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PAYMENT INFO                       │
│  - Card fields                      │
│  - Payment options (icons)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ☑️ CONSENT CHECKBOX                │
│  (I agree to terms + billing)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [COMPLETE PURCHASE - $XXX]         │
│  (high contrast, full width)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🔒 Security badges + Guarantee     │
│  Support contact info               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rule:** Every element should either build trust or move toward conversion. Remove everything else.

---

**The WhatsApp Backup Strategy:**

Email deliverability is never 100%. For high-value events, you need a backup channel.

| Audience | Channel | Expected Show-Up |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| General registrants | Automated WhatsApp (4 messages) | 30-35% |
| VIP prospects | Personal sales team WhatsApp | 60-80% |

**vs. Email only:** 15-20% show-up

---

## The Compound Lift Principle

Don't just fix ONE thing. Stack multiple small improvements for exponential results.

| Improvement | Individual Lift |
|-------------|----------------|
| Video explainer | +40-60% |
| Better headline | +15-25% |
| Social proof with $$ | +10-15% |
| Clearer value prop | +8-12% |
| CTA contrast | +5-10% |
| Bonus hook | +10-20% |

**Compound effect:** 80-120% conversion improvement (conservative) to 200%+ (aggressive)

**Rule:** Never ship just ONE change. Stack 4-5 improvements for exponential lift.

---

## The 20 Commandments

### Landing Pages
1. Lead with transformation, not information
2. Show who's in the room
3. Make the CTA pop with contrast
4. Cut the page length in half
5. Add video (intro + testimonials)
6. Create urgency with real scarcity
7. Give testimonials scannable headlines with $$ amounts
8. Put credibility high, not buried
9. Use accordions for FAQs
10. Build an emotional arc, not a flat list

### Webinar Funnels
11. Never end the conversation after the webinar
12. Fix deliverability BEFORE copy
13. Use WhatsApp as backup channel for high-value events
14. Deliver bonus immediately on thank you page
15. Spot countdown must be real and visible (12 → 8 → 5 → 2 → 1)
16. THE STACK is non-negotiable — value first, price last
17. Use the 78% Rule — prime before the webinar
18. Always mention bonus retention ("keep even if you cancel")

### Checkout & Compliance
19. Clarity over cleverness — never be cute on checkout pages
20. FTC compliance is not optional — disclose billing terms before purchase

## Quotable Insights

### On Diagnosis
> "You don't have an audience problem. You have an infrastructure problem. Your show-up rate was 24.8% before — the demand exists, the delivery is broken."

> "Most funnels don't have 10 problems. They have 1-2 CRITICAL bottlenecks holding everything back. Find the crisis, fix the crisis, unlock the growth."

### On Psychology
> "Loss aversion messaging beats gain-seeking every time. 'Don't attend and LOSE access to $97 handbook' > 'Attend and learn X.'"

> "Most landing pages fail because they talk AT visitors instead of taking them on an emotional journey toward transformation."

### On Post-Webinar
> "Most funnel operators think the conversation ends after the webinar. That's where the REAL money is. Days 3-7 post-webinar = $100K+ per webinar in recovered revenue."

### On Compound Improvements
> "Don't just fix ONE thing. Video explainer + better headline + social proof + value prop = 150% conversion improvement through compounding small lifts."

### On Scarcity
> "Spot countdown creates real FOMO: 12 → 8 → 5 → 2 → 1. The psychology is simple — people don't want to be the one who missed out."

### On CPL
> "CPL optimization isn't about spending less — it's about getting MORE for the same budget. Same $94K spend at $20 CPL = 2.5X more registrants. That's a multiplier, not a cost cut."

### On Deliverability
> "Best copy in the world is worthless if it goes to spam."

### On Projections
> "It's better to show $8.26M in realistic gains than $20M in best-case fantasy. Under-promise, over-deliver. Conservative projections = credibility."

### On Consistency
> "One wrong number in a proposal kills trust. Hero = Overview = Revenue Table = Footer. Every. Single. Number. Must. Match."

### On THE STACK
> "THE STACK is non-negotiable. Build value layer by layer, component by component, until price feels like a relief, not a risk. If they're not thinking 'that's it?!' at price reveal, your stack is too weak."

### On the 78% Rule
> "The sale happens BEFORE the webinar. Your job during the webinar is just to close what's already primed. 78% pre-consumption = 3-5X higher conversion."

### On Bonus Retention
> "'Keep the bonuses even if you cancel' reduces perceived risk to zero. It's not a giveaway — it's a trust accelerator that increases conversions by removing the last objection."

### On Peak Commitment
> "The moment right after THE STACK reveal — maximum value, minimum price — is the peak emotional state. That's when your CTA must be STRONGEST, not weakest."

### On FTC Compliance
> "If a customer can miss the billing terms, you've already failed compliance. Clarity isn't just conversion — it's legal protection."

### On Checkout Clarity
> "On checkout pages, clever copy kills conversions. Users are in decision mode. They need clarity, not creativity. If you have to explain what a button does, it's too clever."

### On Accessibility
> "Accessibility isn't charity — it's 10-15% of your users. White on deep purple? That's 8:1 contrast and it converts. Light gray on white? That's 2:1, and you're losing sales and risking lawsuits."

### Case Study 4: Mindvalley Order Menu Compliance Redesign

**Type:** Subscription checkout page with trials and recurring billing

**Audit Focus:** FTC compliance, WCAG accessibility, billing clarity

**Before:**
- Score: 4/10 (Critical compliance issues)
- Billing terms buried in fine print
- No consent checkbox for recurring billing
- Contrast ratio: 2.3:1 (fails WCAG)
- "Clever" CTA buttons ("Let's Transform!")
- Trial terms unclear
- Cancel process: 4 clicks + email required

**After:**
- Score: 9/10 (Fully compliant)
- Billing terms prominent at point of purchase
- Clear consent checkbox: "I understand I will be billed $X/month"
- Contrast ratio: 7.5:1 (passes WCAG AA)
- Clear CTA: "Subscribe - $15/month"
- Trial terms in plain language: "7 days free, then $15/month"
- Cancel process: 1 click in account settings

**Key Principles Applied:**

1. **Billing Disclosure:**
   ```
   Before: [Subscribe Now] *see terms
   After: [Subscribe - $15/month after 7-day trial]
          ☑️ I understand I will be charged $15/month
   ```

2. **Contrast Fixes:**
   | Element | Before | After |
   |---------|--------|-------|
   | CTA button | Light purple on purple (2.3:1) | White on dark purple (8:1) |
   | Terms text | Gray on white (3:1) | Black on white (12:1) |
   | Error messages | Orange on white (3.5:1) | Red on white (5.5:1) |

3. **Clarity Improvements:**
   | Element | Before | After |
   |---------|--------|-------|
   | CTA | "Begin Your Journey" | "Start 7-Day Trial" |
   | Price | "$0 today" | "7 days free, then $15/month" |
   | Cancel | "Flexible cancellation" | "Cancel anytime with 1 click" |

4. **Accessibility Fixes:**
   - Added alt text to all images
   - Added form labels to all inputs
   - Fixed keyboard navigation order
   - Added ARIA labels to interactive elements

**Business Impact:**
- Eliminated FTC compliance risk ($50K-$500K potential fines avoided)
- Reduced chargeback rate from 2.8% to 0.9%
- Reduced customer service complaints by 45%
- Increased trial-to-paid conversion by 12% (clarity builds trust)
