# The Marisha Skill
## A Growth Hacking Framework for High-Converting Landing Pages

## What Is The Marisha Skill?

The Marisha Skill is a systematic methodology for transforming underperforming landing pages into high-converting assets. It combines conversion psychology, premium UX design, and strategic copywriting into a repeatable framework.

**Core Philosophy:** Most landing pages fail because they talk AT visitors instead of taking them on an emotional journey toward transformation.

## The 5-Phase Framework

### Phase 1: AUDIT
*Score the page before you touch it*

**The 5-Dimension Scoring System (1-10 each):**

| Dimension | What You're Measuring |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Structure** | Page length, information hierarchy, section flow |
| **Copy** | Headlines, CTAs, value propositions, testimonials |
| **Conversion** | Urgency, scarcity, social proof, friction points |
| **Psychology** | Emotional arc, aspiration vs fear, identity transformation |
| **Mobile/UX** | Responsiveness, load time, visual hierarchy |

**Key Audit Questions:**
- [ ] How long is the page? (Ideal: 3,000-6,000px)
- [ ] Is there video content?
- [ ] Does the CTA contrast with the page?
- [ ] Is there urgency/scarcity?
- [ ] Do visitors know "who's in the room"?
- [ ] Are testimonials scannable (headlines, not just quotes)?
- [ ] Is the price anchored or hidden?

---

### Phase 2: PSYCHOLOGY
*Understand what actually drives action*

**The Emotional Arc:**
```
TENSION → PAIN → HOPE → BELIEF → DESIRE → FOMO → ACTION
```

Most pages are flat. Great pages build to a crescendo.

**The 3 Psychological Triggers:**

1. **Aspiration Over Fear**
   - ❌ "95% of AI pilots fail" (assumes they identify with failure)
   - ✅ "Join the top 5% capturing millions in AI value"

2. **Identity Transformation**
   - ❌ "Learn about AI" (information)
   - ✅ "Become the AI-empowered executive" (transformation)

3. **Status & Belonging**
   - "Who's in the room?" matters more than "What's in the course?"
   - Show companies represented, industries, role breakdowns

**The Enemy Principle:**
Every great sales page needs a villain. Define what you're fighting against:
- The old way of doing things
- Competitors who are moving faster
- Consultants who overcomplicate
- Technology that doesn't deliver

---

### Phase 3: COPY
*Words that convert*

**Headline Formula:**
```
[Transformation/Outcome] + [Specificity] + [For Who]
```

Examples:
- ❌ "The AI Sweet Spot For C-Suite Leaders" (descriptive)
- ✅ "Turn AI Into Millions In Enterprise Value" (outcome)

**CTA Principles:**
1. **Contrast** - Button must pop (gold/orange on purple, not purple on purple)
2. **Value** - Say what they GET, not what they DO
   - ❌ "Book a Call"
   - ✅ "Get Your Free AI Opportunity Assessment"
3. **Urgency** - Add scarcity when real
   - "Only 47 seats remaining"
   - "Applications close Friday"

**Testimonial Formula:**
```
[VALUE HEADLINE IN CAPS]
"The actual quote..."
- Name, Title, Company + Logo
```

The headline lets scanners get the point without reading.

**Cut Weak Testimonials:**
- ❌ "Great workshop, Matt!"
- ❌ "Matt is awesome"
- ✅ "Transformed how we approach AI adoption across 3 departments"

5 strong testimonials > 15 mediocre ones.

### Phase 4: STRUCTURE
*The flow that converts*

**The High-Converting Page Flow:**

| Section | Purpose | Ideal Height |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Hero + CTA | Hook + primary action | ~800px |
| Social Proof | Logos, "as seen in" | ~300px |
| Video | Build trust, explain value | ~500px |
| About/Credibility | Why trust this person | ~600px |
| Problem/Solution | The framework/methodology | ~600px |
| Who It's For | Self-selection | ~500px |
| Who's In The Room | Peer validation | ~400px |
| Value Stack | What they get | ~600px |
| Testimonials | Proof it works | ~500px |
| FAQ (accordion) | Objection handling | ~400px |
| Final CTA | Close with urgency | ~400px |

**Total: ~5,000-6,000px** (not 24,000px!)

**Key Rules:**
- Put "Who's In The Room" high - executives care about peers
- Testimonials should be consolidated, not scattered
- FAQs must be accordions (collapsed by default)
- Every scroll should reveal new value

---

### Phase 5: UX & DESIGN
*Make it feel premium*

**The Premium UX Checklist:**

- [ ] **Contrast** - CTA pops against background
- [ ] **Whitespace** - Sections breathe (60-100px padding)
- [ ] **Typography** - Max 2 fonts, clear hierarchy
- [ ] **Animations** - Subtle fade-ins, not distracting
- [ ] **Mobile** - Thumb-friendly, no horizontal scroll
- [ ] **Loading** - Under 3 seconds

**Color Psychology:**
- Purple = Premium, wisdom, transformation
- Gold/Orange = Action, urgency, energy
- Green = Success, money, growth
- Red = Warning, urgency (use sparingly)

**The "Pop" Principle:**
If everything is bold, nothing is bold. Pick ONE thing per section to stand out.
